## Git pre-commit hook

A pre-commit hook is a script, Git runs automatically every time you git commit. If the script exits with an error, the commit is blocked.

Run `npx lint-staged` on terminal before commit to check for errors.
This project uses Husky a Javascript Library that functions as Git hooks automation tool
